# Forecasting and Regression
#### 1. Performed exponential smoothing forecasts on the Honeywell stock prices to forecast the price for 4/16/2018. Used successive values of 0.15, 0.35, 0.55, and 0.75 for the smoothing parameter Œ±. Calculated the MSE of each forecast and used the MSEs of the forecasts to determine the value of Œ± that has provided the most accurate forecast.

#### 2. Used exponential smoothing forecast with ùú∂=ùüé.75, and performed adjusted exponential smoothing forecasts on the Honeywell stock prices to forecast the price for 4/16/2018. Used successive values of 0.15, 0.25, 0.45, and 0.85 for the trend parameter Œ≤. Used the MSEs of forecasts to determine the value of Œ≤ that has provided the most accurate forecast. 

#### 3. Performed a simple regression analysis of Honeywell stock prices versus periods (i.e., 1, 2, 3,‚Ä¶) to forecast the Honeywell stock value for 4/16/2018. Calculated the MSE of this forecast and compare its value with those obtained from parts (1) and (2) above. The regression analysis consists of the following additional details:

* a. Coefficients of correlation and determination, and the interpretations of their values
* b. A histogram of the regression residuals, and the interpretation of its shape
* c. Calculating MSE values
* d.  A Normal probability plot of the residuals
